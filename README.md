# DatabaseExam

This repository contains the source code and resources for the Database Exam project. Below is an explanation of each folder and its contents.

## Folder Structure

### `database_resources`
This folder contains all the necessary resources for setting up and managing the database. It includes SQL scripts, database schemas, and any other files required for initializing and maintaining the database.

### `public`
The `public` folder includes static assets that are publicly accessible. This may consist of images, CSS files, and JavaScript files that are directly served to the client without any processing.

### `src`
The `src` folder holds the source code for the project. This is where the main application logic resides, including both frontend and backend code. The structure within this folder typically follows a standard web application architecture.

### `.eslintrc.json`
This is the configuration file for ESLint, a tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code. It defines the coding standards and rules enforced in the project.

### `.gitignore`
This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git. Commonly ignored files include dependencies, build artifacts, and sensitive information.

### `README.md`
